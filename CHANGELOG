0.0.5:
* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed datasources -> datastores. Didn't think it was worth adding transitional config vars since I'm the only one using this right now.
* Adding specs
* Start working on rails 3 compatibility (one outstanding issue: https://github.com/markrebec/excursion/issues/1)

0.0.4:
* Properly namespacing keys when using the :memcache datasource

0.0.3:
* Ability to remove an app from the pool
* Rake task to remove the running app from the pool
* Config option :register_app (defaults to true) to control whether the railtie registers the app on init, allowing you to "disable" excursion but still use helpers from other apps.

0.0.2:
* Added support for :memcache datasource - requires the dalli gem.
* Refactored helpers, sharing helpers between instances, global helpers available at Excursion.url_helpers.
* Custom error classes, improved exception raising/handling

0.0.1:
* Initial working prototype. Only supports the file datasource.
